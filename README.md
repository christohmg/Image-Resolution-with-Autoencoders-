# Image Resolution with Autoencoders-FLAMINGOS
This project leverages autoencoders to enhance image resolution, focusing on a dataset of flamingo images. i started off by resizing high-resolution images to lower resolutions and then using an autoencoder model to improve image clarity. I utilized techniques like early stopping, checkpointing, and learning rate adjustments to refine the model's performance. The repository includes Python code and instructions for setting up the environment, preparing the dataset, and executing the model for both training and inference phases. Contributions especially feature suggestions, and improvements, are welcome.
